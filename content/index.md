title: Welcome to my digital garden
---

My name is Stoitec, I am a passionate software engineer, my favorite topics are blockchain, DeFI and everything around the exhaustive term **coding**.

Welcome to my digital garden, a place where I store what I learn so I don't forget it. This helps me ensure long-term knowledge retention and fosters the emergence of new ideas. There's no real manual, so feel free to get lost. You'll find a graph at the top to guide you and show how the notes are interconnected.

Consider everything here as a draft; nothing is in its final state. If you're wondering why I publish drafts, I invite you to read the [[cult of done]].

Have fun.
