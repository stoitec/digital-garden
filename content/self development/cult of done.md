The Cult of Done is a pragmatic and effective approach to completing tasks and projects. This cult was created by a group of people working in the field of tech and creativity to encourage productivity and the realization of projects, however incomplete they may be, because often, what seems incomplete to us appears perfect to others.

**This manifesto is based on 13 fundamental principles that I encourage you to follow.**

**1. There are three states of being: Not knowing, Action and Done:**
At the beginning of each task, we find ourselves in the first state, where we do not know, we doubt, and we are both curious and uncertain about the said task. Then we move to action, where our journey begins. We learn, discover, and explore, transitioning from a state of "not knowing" to "knowing." Here, you go through several steps: you will encounter blocks, make mistakes, question your ideas, your approach, until, through iterations, you find the key in the depths of your mind and unlock that famous door behind which hides the end goal, the Done. The task is completed and, <u>as in science, nothing is lost, everything is transformed, and your efforts have become skills and knowledge</u>. These three stages are cyclical and continuous.

**2. Accept that everything is a draft, it helps you to get it DONE:**
Accept that everything you do is a DRAFT, the prototype that you launch into production, the work that you write and publish, nothing that you do will be perfect. Do you think **Satoshi Nakamoto** believed the blockchain was perfect when he released it? NO, it had performance and security issues, but EVERYTHING goes through a continuous cycle of improvement. Accept your imperfection and ship it. When Linus Torvalds deployed Linux at the age of 21, he said, "I'm doing a (free) OS (just a hobby, it won't be big and professional like GNU)," he shipped a project he saw as a draft, and today he has revolutionized the world of tech with it.

**3. There is no editing stage:**
When an artist paints, he does not edit his work, he continues and accepts its imperfections. A musician does not edit their performance, if they make a mistake, they continue and hope the audience didn't notice.

This principle shapes the way our world functions, when you publish something to the world, you lose control over it—learn to accept this. Currently, I am reading math books, and you know what? The one I am reading now is the fourth edition, and from my point of view, the second was already perfect and covered the subject well. (yeah, probably because I'm not good enough to see the difference, but in fact people are often like me)
<u>So do not edit anything, instead, create something new.</u>

**4. Pretending what you're doing, is almost the same as knowing what you are doing, so just accept that and you know what you're doing even if you don't:**
This technique is a bit tricky, but I'll explain it to you. It somewhat aligns with the "fake it until you make it" concept. From a business point of view, I hate this phrase, but in terms of mindset, it makes sense. Look at your favorite YouTubers, check their first videos—I bet you 1BTC they don't look like their current ones. The first ones were lousy, and the new ones are mindblowing in terms of quality. 
<u>Pretend to know and just do it, learn as you ship, and persuade yourself that you KNOW</u>.

**5. Banish procrastination, if you wait more than a week to get an idea done, abandon it:**
You are not forced to forget it, but do something else and set it aside. Do not remain stuck, move to action. If you are not feeling confident about an idea, do not try to make it better, try the next one.

**6. The point of being done is not to finish, but to get other things done:**
Every project will make you better, wiser, more skilled, more competent, so once you've finished it, accept your reward and move on to the next thing, to your next reward.

**7. Once you're done you can throw it away:**
You don't have to keep improving this project, to make it better, burn the work, art is not art, art is what you feel when you create your work. Remember the time you created something you liked, you were probably happy with the result, but what excited you the most, the journey or the destination?

**8. Laugh at perfection, it's boring and keeps you from being done:**
I'm not saying that you should have low quality standards, but if you've finished it, move on to something else. Don't be obsessed with finishing, don't be meticulous.

9. People without dirty hands are wrong, doing something makes you right:
Life is full of people who will try to hold you back, thinking that what is impossible for them must also limit you. But do not confine your horizons to their weaknesses. They will tell you to be reasonable, to think about your financial security, among other things. Be ambitious, take risks, otherwise, you will never know your limits.

**10. Failure counts as done:**
Be ambitious, fail, try, failure is an END in itself. From failure comes a lesson, and from these lessons will result success. So FAIL. In our society, we only see the lucky ones, those who have a four-leaf clover on their path, but you know what? Poor them, they have zero lessons to their credit, they have not known failure, <u>rapid success is a curse.</u>

**11. Destruction is a variant of done:**
Reaching the stage of 'done' is a transition towards something else, as you have understood, whether it comes about through destruction, a mistake, or a conclusion, the transition applies. Destruction counts as a transition, whether intentional or not. Experimentation requires destruction, and from this destruction comes a conclusion that rightly counts as a 'DONE'.

**12. If you have an idea and publish it on the internet, that counts as a ghost of Done:**
Sharing an idea with the world is a completion, it counts as 'DONE'. You do not have to execute it yourself. Consider what has come from open-source: **Satoshi** published a white paper, an idea clearly articulated within a scientific context, and many people joined the project. That was a 'DONE'. <u>Ideas are sometimes vain, let them go.</u>

**13. Done is the engine of more:**
completion empowers you to hear your inner voice, this voice which works to find you other ideas. <u>So finish and listen to what it has to tell you, accept your next mission.</u>
